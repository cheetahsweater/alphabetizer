# The Ana Alphabetizer

The Ana Alphabetizer is a program that takes a set of lines in a text field and organizes them by the first letter of each line.

## Installation

There is no install required, the executable file should just run normally.

## Usage

Simply fill the text field with a set of lines that you want to organize alphabetically. Alternatively, you have the option to open a .txt file with a list formatted in the same way. You then simply click the "Alphabetize" button and the lines will be sorted alphabetically. You can save the end product to a .txt file as well.
